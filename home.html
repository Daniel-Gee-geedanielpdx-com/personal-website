		<h2>Who I am and what I do</h2>
		<p>Hi, my name is Daniel Gee. I'm currently learning web development and am based in Portland Oregon.</p>

		<img src="images/me.jpg" alt="A photo of me" width="400">
		<p>I have always been interested in technology and how it can be used to create amazing things. I started
			learning web development as a hobby and soon realized that I wanted to pursue it as a career.</p>

		<p>[more information about myself and my background here]</p>

		<p>I enjoy working on different kinds of web projects, from simple static websites to complex dynamic
			applications. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more soon to come.</p>

		<audio src="daniel-audio.mp3" controls alt="An audio clip of me explaining my web development skills"></audio>

		<p>I'm always eager to learn new things and improve my skills. I plan on continuing my education and would like
			to learn React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Firebase to name a few in the near future.</p>
